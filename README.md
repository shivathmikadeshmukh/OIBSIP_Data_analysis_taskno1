# 🛒 Retail Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis helps in deriving insights that can support business strategy and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to:

- Understand the structure and quality of the data
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales
- Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as top-selling products, sales by region, and seasonality
- Prepare the dataset for further modeling or reporting

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
   - Reviewed data types, structure, and sample records

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Converted data types (e.g., dates)

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Analyzed individual features like sales, quantity, category, etc.
   - Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots

4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
   - Examined relationships between variables (e.g., sales vs. profit)
   - Grouped and aggregated data by categories, dates, and regions

5. **Time Series Trends**
   - Analyzed sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly)
   - Identified seasonal patterns

6. **Data Visualization**
   - Created bar plots, line graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts for better interpretation
